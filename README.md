# SoupSoftware
This repository contains the software developed for the "Computational Management of Data" course of the master's degree in [Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge) of the University of Bologna.

The goal of the project is to develop a software capable of processing and storing specific bibliographical data. Given CSV and JSON files as input, it is possible to upload their contents in both a relational and a RDF triplestore database. By recalling the developed methods, it is also possible to simultaneously query the databases and retrieve the wanted information. The results are nomally provided to the used as a list of Python objects.
